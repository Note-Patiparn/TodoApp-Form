// One LAST time in this course, set up a React app from scratch
// Render an <App /> component
  // App should be in its own file
// App should render 5 <Joke /> components
  // Each Joke should receive a "question" prop and a "punchLine" prop
  // and render those however you'd like
  
// EXTRA CREDIT:

// Some jokes are only a punch line with no question:

  // E.g.: "Itâ€™s hard to explain puns to kleptomaniacs because they always take things literally."

// If you don't pass in a "question" prop, how might you make it only show the punchline instead?

// Spend time practicing the style of your Joke component
